<h3>🔹 Quick Snapshot</h3>
<p>
I'm a Senior Manager at <a href='https://www.capitalone.com/'>Capital One</a>, leading cybersecurity and strategic initiatives. With a Master's in Computer Science and a strong foundation in <strong>post-quantum hybrid encryption</strong>, I combine deep technical knowledge with hands-on leadership to deliver robust and forward-looking security solutions.
</p>

<h3>Professional Journey & Expertise</h3>
<p>
I began my career after earning a <strong>B.E. in Computer Science & Engineering</strong> (Anna University, India), followed by an <strong>M.S. in Computer Science</strong> (Illinois Institute of Technology, USA). Over the years, I have accumulated substantial experience in:
</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Designing and implementing cryptographic systems</strong> — with emphasis on post-quantum hybrid encryption models</li>
  <li><strong>Steering large-scale cybersecurity initiatives</strong> within the financial sector</li>
  <li><strong>Bridging theory and practice</strong>: translating academic cryptographic research into real-world, compliant, enterprise-grade systems</li>
  <li><strong>Leading cross-functional teams</strong> and driving secure software engineering practices</li>
</ul>
<p>
As a senior member of the engineering community, I bring a mindset grounded in rigorous standards (informed by my IEEE affiliation), strong analytical rigor, and a commitment to long-term architectural integrity.
</p>

<h3>Core Values & What Drives Me</h3>
<p>
<strong>Security through innovation</strong> — I believe that cryptography and security are not just compliance checkboxes, but enablers of trustworthy, resilient systems that uphold privacy and trust.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Adaptability & forward-thinking</strong> — In a world moving toward post-quantum challenges, I stay committed to learning and evolving, blending classical and emerging cryptographic paradigms.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Clarity & collaboration</strong> — Whether communicating complex cryptographic concepts or coordinating with stakeholders across disciplines, I emphasize clarity, alignment, and shared understanding.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Lifelong learning</strong> — My academic journey and professional path reflect a continuous pursuit of knowledge and excellence.
</p>

<h3>Selected Highlights & Credentials</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Master's and Bachelor's degrees in Computer Science / Engineering from reputable institutions</li>
  <li>Senior role at Capital One — overseeing cybersecurity strategy</li>
  <li>Specialized research and professional interest in <strong>post-quantum and hybrid encryption techniques</strong> (relevant to ongoing cryptographic and compliance challenges)</li>
  <li>Active involvement with the <strong>IEEE Computer Society</strong> — bringing standards awareness and professional rigor to my work</li>
</ul>

<h3>Beyond Code: Interests & Passions</h3>
<p>
When I step away from code and cryptography:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>I enjoy <strong>traveling</strong> — discovering natural beauty through national parks and scenic destinations</li>
  <li>I'm a <strong>culinary explorer</strong> — embracing and experiencing diverse food cultures and traditions</li>
  <li>I maintain <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/yourspkp/">a personal photostream</a>, where I test out my Photographic skills</li>
</ul>
<p>
These pursuits help me maintain balance, fuel creativity, and bring fresh perspectives into my work.
</p>

<h3>What I'm Looking Forward To / Open To</h3>
<p>
I'm always open to:
</p>
<ul>
